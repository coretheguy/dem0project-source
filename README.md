# dem0project-source

This is the original source code for the Dem0 Project mod, last modified March 15, 2021. This repository is being made public for archival purpose and for those who want to learn to work with Pizza Tower's (frankly horrendous) 2018 code base with slight modifications.

The latest commit is slightly older than the last released version of the mod (0.821), and as such may feature some changes that are not present there.

Precompiled builds will NOT be made available (aside from an early joke build), so you'll have to compile yourself. Also note that this is NOT AT ALL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FINAL VERSION OF PIZZA TOWER!!! THis is a DECOMPILATION of one of the VERY FIRST PUBLIC DEMOS released in late 2018. I cannot offer any support for this repo, so PLEASE do not make any issues or pull requests as they will be disregarded without any explanation.

This source code is built on Gamemaker Studio 2.2.5, so porting to 2.3 or 2022+ versions will require the project to be converted.

Also included is a noncustom branch, which features slightly less custom content.
